# HandwritingParser
This program uses scikit-learn to train a model for detecting handwritten letters in an image. It uses scikit-image and NumPy to parse the images to pass to scikit-learn. Currently it is only trained on the letters a, b, and c from the images in this repository. It could be trained to detect the entire alphabet by adding more images of handwritten letters.

This can be run using the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/carsonchapman1123/HandwritingParser
cd HandwritingParser
python handwriting_parser.py
```
