# Machine Learning

Currently the only program here uses a classifier to identify letters written on a piece of white paper in dark ink. As long as the program has roughly five of each letter to learn from, it seems to work with 100% accuracy. I have provided three pictures of lowercase a’s, b’s, and c’s.
